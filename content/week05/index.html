<div align="center"><h1>COMS10008 Lab Week 05: Strings</h1></div>

<p>The formative lab task this week does not count towards your credit for the unit. The
main purpose is to learn how to write functions which involve handling arrays and
strings. Instead of open-ended work, there is an optional task about bit-packing this week.</p>

<h2><u>Understand the Task</u></h2>

<p>You are asked to write your own versions of some of the string functions in
the standard library.  Each function should be implemented directly, without
calling any library functions.  (The functions can call each other.) The
declarations of the functions you are asked to write are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">int length(const char s[]);
void copy(char t[], const char s[]);
int compare(const char s[], const char t[]);
void append(char t[], const char s[]);
int find(const char t[], const char s[]);
</pre>

<p>These are intended to be custom versions of <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strcpy</code>, <code>strcmp</code>, <code>strcat</code> and
<code>strstr</code>. The tests will provide the detailed specifications of the functions.</p>

<h2><u>Study the Skeleton Program</u></h2>

<p>You are given this skeleton program and Makefile as a starting point:</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="strings.c">strings.c</a><br/>
<a href="Makefile">Makefile</a></p>

<p>Compile and run the code as usual via:</p>

<pre>make
./strings
</pre>

<p><b>Notation and Design.</b> Array notation is used rather than pointer notation.  You don't need to use
any pointer notation in your answers, but you are allowed to within your own support functions.  It is traditional to use pointer
notation in functions like this, but array notation is arguably superior,
because it is more readable and can actually be more efficient nowadays, because
the compiler with the <code>-O2</code> option has more information about what
you mean so it can optimise better. The program doesn't do anything, except run tests on the functions.  
This is what you would do if you were developing a library module.  The only additions
for a real library module would be: (a) you would add a header
<code>strings.h</code>, like the standard one for users to include, and (b) you
would rename <code>main</code> to avoid a clash with a program that used your
library. You will see that in detail in later assignments.</p>

<p><b>Tests as Specification.</b> Read the tests to find the detailed specification of what each function has
to achieve. Note that, for the <code>compare</code> function, you only need to
return a negative, zero or positive number, not necessarily -1, 0, +1.
Historically, that's for efficiency reasons because you would have to add an
extra unnecessary step to normalise.  A couple of the original
functions unnecessarily return the result string - the custom versions don't,
because it is not possible using only array notation.  The <code>find</code>
function returns an <code>int</code> position rather than a substring for the
same reason.</p>

<p><b>Simplified Types and Const.</b> For example, the return type of <code>length</code> is <code>int</code>,
rather than <code>size_t</code>.  That means it won't work for super-long
strings.  However, for a program which handles such strings, you would
probably want to design a custom string type anyway. The use of the <code>const</code> keyword has advantages.
It helps you to implement the functions, because the compiler
will detect any mistaken attempt to change a string which you are not supposed
to change.  Also, it helps the compiler to optimise the code.</p>

<h2><u>Develop the Program</u></h2>

<p>As usual, it is a case of working in small steps, one test at a time, keeping
your program in a working state. The assignment is about writing loops, so please do not use library functions.  
Obviously, calling <code>strlen</code> to make <code>length</code> easy isn't allowed.  
The efficiency of your functions isn't tested.  But efficiency is tradionally a big concern 
in writing reusable library functions. Don't agonize over efficiency, especially if it is at the expense of readability
or correctness.  I suggest you just give a little thought
to how many times each function loops through the relevant characters. If you
are <em>fascinated</em> by efficiency, you could do timings, but that is definitely not
required.</p>

<p><b>Loops.</b> Suppose you write a loop <code>for (int i=0; i&lt;length(s); ...)...</code>.
You might think that the function <code>length</code> is called each time round
the loop.  Since <code>length</code> itself involves a loop, that would be
inefficient.  But if <code>s</code> is declared <code>const</code> and you are
using the <code>-O2</code> option to compile for instance, the compiler <em>will</em> notice
that <code>length(s)</code> only needs to be called once. If you write <code>for (int i=0; i&lt;length(s); ...)...</code> then there
are two loops through the characters, one in the length function, and the one
you've just written.  You <em>may</em> be able to get away with one loop by
writing <code>for (int i=0; s[i] != '\0'; ...)...</code>. If you write <code>for (int i=0;...)...</code> there may be one more thing
you need to do, at the end of the string.  But the variable <code>i</code> is no
longer available, because it is local to the loop.  If instead you write
<code>int i; ... for (i=0;...)...</code> then <code>i</code> is available after
the loop ends, and may have a useful value in it.</p>

<p><b>Enjoy Programming!</b> Make sure your programming adheres to the <a href="../COMS10008_Style.pdf" target="_blank">Unit Programming Style Guide</a>.
Enjoy programming, our lab team and the forum are there for you if you need help!</p>

<h2><u>OPTIONAL: An Extra Task Packed full of Colour</u></h2>

<p>Only if you have time left, there is an optional task on bit packing for this week instead of an open-ended task. 
There is no submission, so explore the task as little or as much as you want to and can within the time limit given.
This task comes with its own code and tests. The task is to write some functions which handle bit-packed data to get more experience on dealing with binary information:</p>

<pre>unsigned int colour(int r, int g, int b, int a);
void components(unsigned int c, int rgba[4]);
unsigned int point(int x, int y, int z);
void coordinates(unsigned int p, int xyz[3]);
void binary(int n, char s[33]);
void hex(int n, char s[9]);
</pre>

<p>The <code>colour</code> function packs four colour components (red, green,
blue, 'alpha' = opacity) into a single unsigned integer.  The
<code>components</code> function unpacks a colour into an array of its
components.</p>

<p>The <code>point</code> function packs three signed coordinates into a 3D
position, held in an unsigned integer.  The <code>coordinates</code> function
unpacks a position into an array of its three signed coordinates.  The
coordinates are in the range <code>-512..511</code> so that they can be
represented using ten bits each.</p>

<p>The <code>binary</code> function converts the integer <code>n</code> into a
binary string consisting of 32 digits, each <code>'0'</code> or
<code>'1'</code>, in the array provided, which must be at least 33 characters
long to allow for a null character at the end. The <code>hex</code> function
similarly converts <code>n</code> into an 8-hex-digit string.</p>

<p>Here's a skeleton program, to get you started and to
provide the tests.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="bits.c">bits.c</a><br/>

<p>The program can be used by typing <code>./bits</code> to run the tests. Printing a number in binary is solved by the two
functions <code>binary</code> and <code>printBinary</code>. The first deals
with the logic of the problem (converting a number into binary text) and the
second deals with the input/output (printing the result text).  This allows the
logic function to be tested easily, while keeping the I/O function simple so
that it doesn't need to be tested. The <code>components</code>, <code>coordinates</code>, <code>binary</code>,
and <code>hex</code> functions have an array passed to them for them to fill
in the answer.  The functions would be prettier if they returned the answer, but
arrays can't be returned from functions (without using pointer notation).  An
alternative would be to define suitable structs to use instead of arrays, but
the extra complexity doesn't seem worth it. The <code>testComponents</code> function is reasonably short and neat, with
only one line per test.  To achieve that, an extra function
<code>checkComponents</code> has been added.  The same applies to the other
functions which take array arguments.  In general, you should use your normal
programming skills to make testing functions short and neat, just as much as any
other functions in your programs. In <code>checkComponents</code>, for example, the array passed to the
<code>components</code> function is first filled with incorrect characters.
Then, if the <code>components</code> function fails to fill in one of the
characters, the test will detect that and fail (otherwise the random content
might accidentally be correct, causing the test to succeed when it
shouldn't). You are allowed to utilise code snippets you developed for the open-ended task of your first coursework, if this is helpful.</p>
