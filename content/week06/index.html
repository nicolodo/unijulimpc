<div align="center"><h1>COMS10008 Lab Week 06: Text</h1></div>

<p>The main purpose of this week's task is to practice pointers and memory
management.  The task is formative and does not count towards your unit mark. The task may also provide you with some insight about how modules
work, and about how strings are implemented in other languages.</p>

<h2><u>Understand the Task</u></h2>

<p>You are asked to write some functions which handle strings, wrapped as text
objects to add pointer and memory management.  The functions you are asked to
write are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">text *newText(char *s);
void freeText(text *t);
int length(text *t);
char get(text *t, int i);
void set(text *t, int i, char c);
text *copy(text *t);
int compare(text *t1, text *t2);
void append(text *t1, text *t2);
text *slice(text *t, int i, int j);
int find(text *t, text *p);
</pre>

<p>These functions form a potentially reusable library. The type
<code>text</code> is a custom type set up for this assignment. It roughly
matches how string types are implemented in some other languages. As usual, the tests
will provide the detailed specifications of the functions.</p>

<h2><u>Understand the Type <code>text</code></u></h2>

<p>The text type is declared in <code>text.h</code> and defined in
<code>text.c</code> as:</p>

<pre>struct text {
    int capacity;
    char *content;
};
typedef struct text text;
</pre>

<p>The structure contains a dynamically allocated character array and its capacity.
The capacity is the total size of the array, not the length of the string stored
in it. The length of the string in it is determined by a terminating null
character as usual, so <code>strlen</code> can be used to find it.</p>
<p>The <code>typedef</code> statement defines the name
<code>text</code> as an abbreviation for the full type name <code>struct
text</code>. A variable declared as <code>text *t</code> involves two pointers.  The first
is <code>t</code> itself, which points to a structure.  Its purpose is to allow
the structure to be updated by the functions it is passed to, for example
<code>set</code> doesn't have to return anything.</p>
<p>The second pointer is <code>t->content</code> which points to the allocated array.  Its purpose is to allow
the array to change size, without the structure having to move so, for example,
<code>append</code> doesn't have to return anything.</p>

<h2><u>Study the Skeleton</u></h2>

<p>You are provided with three files.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="text.h">text.h</a><br/>
<a href="text.c">text.c</a><br/>
<a href="Makefile">Makefile</a></p>

<p><b>Module Structure.</b> You are being asked to write a program in almost the same way as in previous
assignments. The differences are that a header has been added, and that the test
and <code>main</code> functions are included conditionally, so that the
assignment roughly mimics a real library module. The program defines its test code between lines <code>#ifdef
test_text</code> and <code>#endif</code>. That's called conditional
compilation. The idea is that the variable <code>test_text</code> is defined when testing the module, and then
the test and
<code>main</code> functions are included. If the module were used in a
bigger program, the variable would not be defined, and the test and
<code>main</code> functions would
be left out, to avoid unnecessary bulk and to avoid a name clash with the
program's <code>main</code> function.</p> 
<p><b>Upgraded Makefile and API.</b> The Makefile has been upgraded to support module testing.
The compile command now includes the option <code>-Dtest_text</code>, which causes
<code>test_text</code> to be defined as if with <code>#define</code>. You need
to use this option, even if you don't use the Makefile. The header file <code>text.h</code> allows other programs to use the
text module.  It is not important for this assignment, <em>except</em> that the
<code>text.c</code> file includes it, to provide a
cross-check that the declarations in the header file match the definitions.  So,
you have to keep it in the same directory as <code>text.c</code> while you are
working on the assignment, but you shouldn't change it. The header is included with the line <code>#include "text.h"</code>, which
has double quotes instead of angle brackets to indicate that the header is
included from the current directory, rather than the system header
directory. You will notice that most of the comments are in <code>text.h</code> rather
than <code>text.c</code>.  That's because a programmer using the module would
be expected to read the header for documentation, and to have little interest
in the implementation details. The declaration and the typedef are in <code>text.h</code>, and the
definition is in <code>text.c</code>. The header forms the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API</a>
for the module.</p>

<p><b>Encapsulation and Access.</b> In the header file, the <code>text</code> structure is declared, but not
defined.  That means a program that uses the text module cannot 'see inside'
the text structure, so cannot access its fields, or even find out how
big it is to allocate memory for it.  The program can <em>only</em> call
the official functions provided in the header file. This is called encapsulation.  It makes sure that programs do not
depend on any details of how the text module is implemented, allowing the
text module to be developed independently, and changed without having to
re-write any programs that use it.  It also allows the module to
provide safety guarantees. Since a program can only use the functions provided, these have to cover
everything.  In particular, <code>get</code> has to be provided as a
replacement for <code>s[i]</code>, because the characters in the text
cannot be accessed directly.  Similarly, <code>set</code> is provided
to update the i'th character. The <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> functions can be made just as
efficient as direct array indexing.  You aren't required to do that, but the
best way would be to declare them as <code>extern inline</code> and add
the <code>-flto</code> compiler option to do
cross-module optimization.</p>

<h2><u>Develop the Module</u></h2>

<p><b>Allocation Policy.</b> Develop the module, function by function and test by test, as usual.
Note that it is normal to allocate a small amount of memory initially, and then
multiply by some factor where necessary. You are asked to allocate 24 bytes initially, and to multiply by 2 where
necessary, so that the tests can check the capacity explicitly. Why 24? Because experiments show that the smallest memory block allocated by
<code>malloc</code> has room for 24 bytes, so asking for less than that gains
nothing. Why 2? Because it is the simplest choice, though something smaller such
as 1.5 can sometimes work slightly better. When implementing <code>newText</code>, be careful in case the initialization
string needs more than 24 bytes, not forgetting to include the null marker in
the count. Also note that <code>newText</code> needs two calls to <code>malloc</code>. When you are implementing, you can use standard string
functions.  For example, in the definition of <code>length</code> you can
use <code>strlen</code>.  This assignment is not about rewriting the
standard functions, it is about encapsulation and memory management.</p>

<p><b>Safety First.</b> Your functions should ensure that the string in a <code>text</code> object
<strong><i>always</i></strong> has a null character at the end, and
<strong><i>always</i></strong> fits in its array.  Of course, such guarantees depend
on all of the functions you provide being implemented completely correctly. 
Ideally, the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> functions should check
that the index passed is within range.  You can do that with an assert.
(Asserts can be switched off for production compiling, so that they have no
effect on final efficiency.)</p>

<p><b>Limited Testing.</b> Even with the advanced debugging options, it is impossible to test dynamic
allocation perfectly. For example, some of the tests check the value of <code>t->capacity</code>,
but they can't test that the value matches the amount you actually allocated in
your call to <code>malloc</code>. And <code>freeText</code> can't be tested at
all, other than via the <code>-fsanitize=address</code> option. As another example, it is impossible to test that the <code>get</code> and
<code>set</code> functions check that their indexes are in range.</p>

<h2><u>OPTIONAL: Open-ended Library Extensions</u></h2>

<p><b>Your Text Library.</b> Only if you have time left, extend your library with further text functions of your choosing. 
Examples of extensions could include the provision of functions for mirroring text backwards, checking for palindromes, 
or faster than naive sub-string matching. Again, make sure you write unit tests for the functions you implement.
