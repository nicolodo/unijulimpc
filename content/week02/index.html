<div align="center"><h1>COMS10008 Lab Week 02: Grade</h1></div>

<p>The lab task this week is formative again, it will not count towards your credit for the unit.  The
main aims are to practice writing simple programs, and for you to get acquainted with the university marking scale. </p>

<h2><u>University Marking</u></h2>

<p>Formative work like this task prepares you for later assessment, it is essential to do this work properly, but it is not marked. 
In contrast, when you do a summative coursework assignment or an exam, you get a mark for it. The
mark is a number from 0 to 100.  It is often called a percentage, but it isn't a
percentage <em>of</em> anything.  The mark is not on a linear scale.  The first
few marks are easy to get, and higher marks are harder and harder to get. For more information
how this unit is marked, see the <a href="../COMS10008_Marking.pdf">Marking Guidelines for COMS10008</a>.
</p>

<p>The marks from the various components of a unit are combined into a weighted
average to form a unit mark. The marks for the units you take in a year are
combined into an average, weighted by the number of credits each unit carries, to form a year
mark. The year marks you gain over the course of your degree are combined into
an average weighted by contribution (no contribution from the first year, and
the highest contribution coming from the final year). The final mark is
converted into a grade, with various borderline rules.</p>

<h2><u>The Specification</u></h2>

<p>Your task is to write a program in C called <code>grade.c</code> which takes
in an integer percentage between 0 and 100 as a command line argument to the program, 
representing the final average mark for a degree, and prints out the corresponding grade. The
program prints <code>First</code> for first class (a mark of 70 or more),
<code>Upper</code> <code>second</code> for upper second class (60 to 69),
<code>Lower</code> <code>second</code> for lower second class (50 to 59),
<code>Third</code> for third class (40 to 49), <code>Fail</code> (0 to 39), or
<code>Invalid mark</code> if the input is not a valid mark. The program should
ignore borderline issues, and other outcomes (ordinary degree, certificate,
diploma, aegrotat, credit transfer). The program should use all the functions provided
in the skeleton program and pass all provided tests.</p>

<h2><u>Study the Skeleton Program</u></h2>

<p>To help you get started, a skeleton program and Makefile have been provided
for you to download or copy-paste. (If necessary, rename <code>Makefile.txt</code> back to <code>Makefile</code> after
downloading):</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="grade.c">grade.c</a><br/>
<a href="Makefile">Makefile</a></p>

<p><b>Improved Makefile</b>. If you type <code>make</code> on its own, this will compile
<code>grade.c</code> to <code>grade</code> for Linux, Mac and the Linux sub-system for Windows 10 (or for Native Windows only <code>grade.exe</code>). 
If you have any other program, in <code>program.c</code> for example, then you can type <code>make program</code> to compile it.</p>
In the first line of a rule, <code>%</code> is a pattern matching any program
name. In the other lines of a rule, <code>$@</code> stands for the characters
matched by the pattern in the first line.</p>

<p><b>Compile and Run the Skeleton Code</b>.Try compiling it and running the skeleton code either with minimum settings this:</p>
<pre>$ clang -std=c11 -Wall grade.c -o grade
$ ./grade 0
Invalid mark
</pre>
<p>or better with full compiler options like this:</p>
<pre>$ make
$ ./grade 0
Invalid mark
</pre>
<p>Compile using the <code>make</code> command to add the full set of options. The extra
options help by providing more compile-time warnings, detecting run-time errors
sooner, and allowing you to use a debugger. This may not be important yet, but
it will be in later assignments. The program works already, <strong><i>but</i></strong> not correctly.  It prints out
<code>Invalid mark</code> all the time. Your aim should be to improve it gradually.</p>

<p><b>The Two Parts of the Program.</b> The program looks somewhat long, but that's mostly because of the functions which have been
provided for you.  You won't have to write much yourself. The first part of the program is the part you are supposed to work on. The
second part is user interface and testing functions which have been written for you, and which <strong><i>you should not change</i></strong>.</p>

<p><b>Small Functions.</b>There is no function longer than about a dozen lines, and you won't need to
write a function longer than that either.</p>

<p><b>Enumerated Constants.</b>There are enumerated constant names <code>G1</code> etc. for the grades.
These are integer codes.  Nothing in the program should depend on exactly what
codes are used, and <b><i>you shouldn't change them</i></b>.  To see what they mean,
look at the <code>print</code> function which prints them out.</p>

<p><b>Self-Testing Programs.</b> For professional programs it is important that the functionality of the program is tested within the program itself (or alternatively a testing framework). This gives confidence
to the programmer and others who edit/use the program later that it works correctly. One type of testing involves checking the correct workings of 
small parts (such as functions) which is called 'unit testing'. Try running the skeleton program like this with no argument:</p>
<pre>$ ./grade
... assertion fails on line ...
</pre>
<p>This triggers the testing, and this is how you should most often run the
program while working on it.  The exact error message you get
depends on your compiler and programming environment, but it should include
somewhere the line number in the program of the test which fails.
The <code>main</code> function checks how many arguments you have
typed in. If none, it calls the <code>test</code> function.  If one, it calls
the <code>convert</code> and <code>grade</code> functions, and prints the
result.</p>

<p><b>Testing the Functions <code>grade</code> and <code>convert</code>.</b>
The first few tests help you to develop the <code>grade</code> function.
Then the remaining tests help you develop the <code>convert</code> function. 
The tests use the <code>assert</code> function which takes a boolean argument.  If the
argument is <code>true</code>, it does nothing, but if the argument is <code>false</code>, it
crashes with an error message which includes the line number of the failed
assertion. The tests for <code>grade</code> only check the boundary points.  It should
be obvious what the <code>grade</code> function is expected to do on the
numbers in between. Other functions such as <code>print</code> aren't tested, because it
is difficult to test functions that do input or output.  You will have to trust
them.</p>

<p><b>Your own Support Functions.</b>You can probably write the <code>grade</code> function in one piece.  But the
<code>convert</code> function may be too complex for that.  It is strongly
suggested that you break it down into smaller functions. Suggestions might be to
write a function <code>digit</code> which checks whether a character is a digit,
and a separate function to check validity, or perhaps functions
which separately handle the cases where the string is 1, 2 or 3 characters long.
<b><i>Never</i></b> stuff too much code into one function, making it too
big and unwieldy. You can do the assignment without library functions or loops (though you can
use either if you want to).</p>

<p><b>String Handling.</b> A mark string is passed to the <code>convert</code> function as an array of
characters. The first argument <code>n</code> is the number of characters in the string.  It has been added so that you don't
have to call any library functions if you don't want to. (Normally, <code>strlen</code> would be used.)
For example, if <code>n</code> is <code>2</code> then the two characters are <code>mark[0]</code> and <code>mark[1]</code>. 
The <code>const</code> keyword is included to help you, by making the compiler give an error message if you accidentally try to change the characters
in the string.</p>

<p><b>Common Sense.</b> If you look at the first three tests in <code>testValidity</code>, you might
think you should check for decimal points, letters and negative numbers.  But if
you read the comment, these are all just examples of input containing
non-digits. So, what you should be checking is that every character <b><i>is</i></b> a
digit. The autotests have several purposes.  They set a good example, provide a
precise specification of some details of how the functions operate, provide some
example snippets of code.</p> 

<p><b>Check your Progress.</b> If this coursework was marked, then the first 50% of the mark would be given for passing the tests correctly.
Passing all the tests would be worth the full 50%, and passing only some of them would be proportionally less. Everybody can aim for
perfection on this half of the work. (We would of course use our own copy of the tests, to make sure you have not changed them or the program structure.)</p>

<h2><u>A Professional Approach</u></h2>

<p>However you are going to solve the task, you should follow some golden rules of software development:</p>

<p><b>RULE #1: Take Small Steps.</b> That means: start with a working program.  That's why you are given a working
skeleton. Then write or change only a couple of lines before re-compiling and
re-running the program.  This is very efficient because you get the maximum
amount of help from the computer and, if there is a problem, you know exactly
where to look for it.</p>

<p><b>RULE #2: Write Tiny Functions.</b> Divide a program into very small functions. The whole of a function should be
visible at a glance in your editor, without scrolling. A function should be a
bite-sized chunk of programming that you can tackle with confidence.
The less confident you are, the smaller the functions should be.</p>

<p><b>RULE #3: Automate Testing.</b> Don't repetitively and boringly keep trying out your program in different
ways to see if it is working.  Build the testing into the program
itself, re-running all the tests frequently to make sure you haven't broken
anything. The tasks in this unit are designed to get you into the good habit 
of doing this for your whole career.</p>

<p>You may also want to have a look at the <a href="../COMS10008_Style.pdf" target="_blank">Unit Programming Style Guide</a> to write code that complies with the unit style, which is strongly 
recommended for all coding in the unit. Remember, your task is to change the <code>grade</code> and <code>convert</code>
functions, and any supporting functions you define, until the goal of the program is achieved and - as a side effect - all the tests pass.
It is a good idea to concentrate on the first test that fails, get that to pass,
incidentally checking that all the previous tests still pass.  Each extra test
that passes represents good progress.</p>

<h2><u>Writing the Program</u></h2>

<p>To start with, you should get the <code>grade</code> function to pass its
tests, one by one.  You need to use some common sense.  The tests say that
<code>0</code> and <code>39</code> should give the answer <code>Fail</code>. You
should make sure all the numbers in between also give the answer
<code>Fail</code>, but <em>not</em> by dealing with them individually one by
one. Once those tests pass, start on the <code>convert</code> function.  For
validity, the number of characters in the array should be <code>1</code> or
<code>2</code> or <code>3</code>. You can deal with each of the three cases
separately if you want. Each character should be a digit, if there are two digits the first
should not be zero, and if there are three digits, they should be exactly
<code>'1'</code> and <code>'0'</code> and <code>'0'</code>.</p>

<p><b>Design.</b> The hardest parts are probably those that check if a string is valid, and convert it
into an integer. To check validity of a string, you can first check the length. It should be
1, 2, or 3.  For each of these lengths, you can check the individual
characters. You can convert the string to an integer in a similar way by dealing with the
three cases separately. Alternatively, you can use more general validity checking or conversion of
arbitrary integer strings, and/or you can use standard functions to do some of
the work.

<p><b>Characters and Digits.</b> The type for a character is <code>char</code>.  A character value is written
using single quotes, e.g. <code>'5'</code> for the digit 5.  A character is
really an integer code, e.g. <code>'A'</code> is just a synonym for
<code>65</code>, but you shouldn't write functions which depend on knowing what
the codes are. Suppose the user types in <code>./grade 56</code>.  Then the argument is
first represented in the program as a piece of text <code>"56"</code>.  That is
really an array containing the digits <code>'5'</code> and <code>'6'</code>. The
digits are codes for the decimal symbols.  They are not yet numbers.  The code
for the digit <code>'5'</code> is <strong>not</strong> the number
<code>5</code>.  You are not supposed to write functions based on knowing
what the code for <code>'5'</code> is.  However, you <strong><i>are</i></strong>
allowed to use the fact that the codes for the digits are next to each other.
So, if you have a <code>char</code> variable <code>ch</code> containing one of
the ten digits, you can write <code>ch - '0'</code> to convert it into a
number.</p>

<p><b>Arrays.</b> The mark that the user types in is passed to the <code>convert</code> function
in an array called <code>mark</code>.  This array <code>is</code> a string, such
as <code>"56"</code>.  The number of characters in the string, e.g.
<code>2</code> is passed in another argument <code>n</code>.  (The array is
actually one character longer <code>{'5','6','\0'}</code> because a valid string
always has a terminating marker character at the end, so that the length can be
counted instead of being passed in, usually using the <code>strlen</code>
function.) The digits can be extracted from the array using
<code>mark[0]</code>, <code>mark[1]</code>..., but you should be careful not to
access <code>mark[i]</code> unless you know that that the length of the
array is at least <code>i + 1</code>, because that could access memory that
doesn't belong to the program, causing it to crash with a segfault.</p>

<p><b>String Operations via Library Functions.</b> The assignment is arranged so that you can do everything without calling any
library functions, if you want.  This can be a useful exercise, to make sure you
understand all the details. But if you are comfortable that you could handle
the details if you needed to, and you want to take a shortcut by calling a
library function, that's fine. The relevant headers (<code>stdlib.h</code>, <code>ctype.h</code>, ...) have been
included in the skeleton program to make these functions available. 
For instance, a call <code>atoi(mark)</code> converts a valid mark string into an
integer. Type "C atoi" into Google to find documentation for the
<code>atoi</code> ("ascii to int") function.  You may eventually need to
find out what it does in unusual cases... A call <code>isdigit(ch)</code> checks whether a character is a digit.  It is
equivalent to <code>(('0' &lt;= ch) &amp;&amp; (ch &lt;= '9'))</code>. You can temporarily add a call to the <code>printf</code> function, e.g.
<code>printf("n=%d\n",n);</code> or <code>printf("m0=%c\n",mark[0]);</code> at
any point to check the values of variables.  It is normal to do this when you
are unsure what's happening, but don't forget to delete or comment out these
calls once your program is working correctly. Enjoy programming, our lab team and the forum are there for you if you need help!
Once you pass all the tests you have finished the closed part of the assignment.</p>

<h2><u>Keep Writing Programs</u></h2>

<p>If this was a summative coursework, then there would be an open-ended part of the assignment, for the other 50% of the
marks. Never attempt it unless you have successfully completed the grade
program, and you have time left. In general, you are not expected to spend more
than 5 hours per week on assignments (partly in the lab session and partly on
your own). You would gain marks towards the 50% of the open-ended task based on the knowledge, skill, style, creativity, and effort you show - 
where we take a manual, brief look at what you have produced.</p>

<p><b>A typical open-ended task could be...</b> Write another C program that either: 
1) allows checking that a string is a valid new <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/advice/iam/usernamesandpasswords.html" target="_blank">university username</a>,
2) allows checking the strength of a password, or 3) allows playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.</p>

<p>Thus, if you have time left try implementing some of these suggestions! Make sure your programming adheres to the <a href="../COMS10008_Style.pdf" target="_blank">Unit Programming Style Guide</a> and that you write your code as well as code that tests your program like in the first part of this task!
